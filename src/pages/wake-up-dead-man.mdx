The conflict at the centre of the third instalment of the *Knives Out* franchise is between two opposing views of the role of religion, specifically Catholicism,
and how it should be practised and preached. The whodunnit setting of *Wake Up Dead Man* features two differing ideologies, On the one hand
you have a young priest (Jud Duplenticy) with a violent past who found forgiveness, salvation and peace in the church. On the other, the older, established priest
of the parish, Monsignor Wicks.

Wicks views his faith a battle, with the modern world on one side and him on the other. He weaponises shame and sin to keep his close-knit and ever-shrinking group
of parishioners in check. His inner circle all have some pain in their past that they hope to absolve or cure through their faith. They seem to take comfort in
the idea that they can hold themselves apart from the rest of the population through their piety. They are clearly uncomfortable with Wicks' methods, but something
in his shaming of newcomers, in the way that he doubles down on any perceived sin or indiscretion, makes them feel some comforting level of superiority.

This creates an atmosphere not just of anger and resentment, but also of fear, fear of being caught in the crosshair of the Monsignor's righteous wrath. 
His own anger and pain stem from his upbringing with a single mother, who was roundly shamed and vilified by his family and the wider community 
and who's story is seen as an original sin for the parish as a whole. The problem with this approach is that if you cannot forgive others, 
you are also not able to forgive yourself, or even to admit to serious sins, for fear of being cast out. The true reward for forgiving your
enemy is the ability to approach yourself with compassion.

Father Jud offers a counterweight here. He had been unable to forgive himself for killing an opponent during a boxing match. He had turned to various vices and
self-loathing, but found peace in the unconditional forgiveness offered by the Catholic Church. For him, Wicks' approach is the antithesis of everything he thinks
the church is about. He wants to welcome the world with open arms, as Jesus did, not create a small radical group that looks down on the rest of humanity. In the end
we see an act of grace, the detective Benoit Blanc is inspired by Jud and refuses to name the murderer in front of her community, instead allowing her to come of
her own accord and confess to Father Jud. He chooses not to shame her, not to use the Wicks' tactics, but rather to allow her to confess her
sins and be listened to, understood and forgiven, rather than publicly shamed and humiliated. 

The message of the film is theological as well as political. We were not put on this earth to judge ourselves or one another, but we are given the chance to act
with grace, to forgive ourselves and others. Creating exclusive groups that view the rest of the world with derision may feel comforting, 
but in the long run it only leads to more pain, resentment, dishonesty and suffering for those who choose to view humanity, and themselves, in these 
black and white terms of good and evil, saved and damned.
