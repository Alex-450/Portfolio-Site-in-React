The UK is now isolated from the rest of the world, the survivors that are left will have to fend for themselves and can have no expectation of rescue.

Showers are taken in public to ensure no one uses more than their fair share of water. A tattered St George’s flag flutters in the breeze.

There’s a doctor on the mainland, but the locals don’t trust him, there are rumours that he’s gone mad and spends his time burning the bodies of the countless dead. The community’s isolation is their greatest protection but also stands in the way of any real salvation or progress. Culture and social change has regressed hundreds of years and no one has the courage to do anything about that in the face of the rage-infected horde."}),(0,r.jsx)("p",{children:"The parallels here with an isolated and broken UK are clear to see, goods are scarce and healthcare difficult to access, trust of outsiders is at an all time low.

There are also parallels in the way that Spike’s dad sensationalises his first trip to the mainland and ignores Spike when he tries to remind him that he was so shaken by what he saw that he could hardly hold his bow steady by the end of their excursion. This sort of disregard for the truth has also become commonplace in public life in the last few decades."}),(0,r.jsx)("p",{children:"But that is not the only story being told here. As our hero traverses the countryside in search of the medical care that Isla so clearly needs, other themes become apparent. The landscapes are truly breathtaking, we pass the Sycamore Gap twice, with the tree still intact in this alternate universe, we pass through Cheddar Gorge and see the Angel of the North, surrounded by forest now, but still standing tall. The film at these points is a love letter to the North East of England, the landscapes made even more awe-inspiring by the eery quiet that envelops them. And despite the Holy Island community’s isolationist approach and fear-based setup, it is a true community, with everyone playing a role, and celebration through music and drinking a cornerstone of their communal life."}),(0,r.jsx)("p",{children:"Though the film’s message initially seems to be totally bleak, with the political allegory reinforcing the doom and gloom of the contemporary news cycle, there is a thread of hope running throughout. Families and communities might not be perfect, but they help us to survive even through the darkest of times. When we meet the doctor at last, we find that he has grown obsessed with death, erecting a monument to those who have died in the course of the outbreak in an attempt to remind people that they all will die. He explains the latin phrase “memento mori” (remember you must die) and helps Spike to come to terms with the inevitable end his mother’s life. Death is the only inevitability in this life, change the only constant. There is something that should make us feel optimistic in that, a reminder that all things pass. When Spike starts a fire to distract the guards at the gate and escape to the mainland with his mother, we see the St George’s flag burning as he leaves: revolution through death and rebirth perhaps. The natural world healing itself as human impact lessens after the rage virus takes hold, with huge herds of deer stampeding across the lush fields and forests, are also a testament to this theme of renewal."}),(0,r.jsx)("p",{children:"In 28 Years Later we see a despairing look at the state of the UK, but not from someone who has given up hope, or fallen out of love with everything that is great about the island and its people."}),(0,r.jsx)("hr",{}),(0,r.jsx)(s.A,{videoId:"mcvLKldPM08"}),(0,r.jsx)("hr",{}),(0,r.jsx)("h6",{children:(0,r.jsx)("strong",{children:"Bibliography"})}),(0,r.jsx)("div",{style:{wordWrap:"break-word"},children:(0,r.jsxs)("p",{children:["[1] ",(0,r.jsx)("a",{target:"_blank",rel:"noreferrer",href:"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/22/worlds-media-ask-how-it-went-so-wrong-for-plague-island-britain-covid",children:"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/22/worlds-media-ask-how-it-went-so-wrong-for-plague-island-britain-covid"})," [Accessed: 26 June 2025]"]})})]})}},3498:e=>{"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('[{"title":"Navigating Trauma with Humour","filmTitle":"Sorry, Baby","year":"2025","director":"Eva Victor","link":"/sorry-baby","dateAdded":"01/09/2025"},{"title":"A Samurai Road Movie","filmTitle":"The Hidden Fortress","year":"1958","director":"Akira Kurosawa","link":"/hidden-fortress-road-movie","dateAdded":"20/07/2025"},{"title":"Love Letter / Obituary","filmTitle":"28 Years Later","year":"2025","director":"Danny Boyle","link":"/28-years-later","dateAdded":"28/06/2025"},{"title":"The Cost of Art","filmTitle":"Fitzcarraldo","year":"1982","director":"Werner Herzog","blogBody":"Here is the text for my second blog","link":"/fitzcarraldo-cost-of-art","dateAdded":"22/06/2025"},{"title":"Radical or not?","filmTitle":"Black Panther","year":"2018","director":"Ryan Coogler","blogBody":"Can a film made by Marvel (and therefore Disney) really be a radical moment in the history of film and popular culture?
