As M. Gustave rudely points out during the interview, his new employee has zero experience, zero education and zero family, he has arrived with nothing, both physically and figuratively. Zero is a refugee and torture survivor from (again fictional) Aq Salim al-Jabat, and is portrayed in the most positive manner throughout the film, his courage, pluckiness and loyalty are on constant display. Zero is stopped by armed patrols whilst travelling by train twice during the film, and asked to leave the carriage, leading M.

Even his friends can fall into the trap of seeing his (perceived) shortcomings as the result of his ethnic and geographical background. This conversation also emphasises that dialogue between local inhabitants and immigrants/refugees can result in deeper understanding and therefore support and friendship. As Anderson said in a clip for the UNHCR, “The movie is a fiction of course, but the character is modelled on a real person and his story is very similar to many other real people’s.

Refugees are people like us, under extreme conditions, when they lose their homes and families when catastrophic circumstances force them to flee.”"}),(0,i.jsx)("p",{children:"The Grand Budapest Hotel does not tell us anything particularly new about the plight of refugees, nor does it focus on this experience for its content.

This is just to name a few of the elements of this unlikely superhero flick being used to claim it as cultural triumph.
